# Description

This library is a rather quick and dirty attempt. It applies a simplistic
genetic algorithm to maximize a given fitness over trees.

# Building

The example program in ```main.cpp``` was successfully compiled with gcc 6.2.0.
You might need to modify the makefile to suit your c++ compiler.
